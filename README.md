# Kubernetes Adoption Framework

The Kubernetes Adoption Framework (KAF) is an opinionated, flexible, batteries included approach to adopting Kubernetes within your organization. The KAF approaches the journey to Kubernetes as a convenient super-abstraction that can be used by teams and companies to achivee the following goals:

* Build a change engine within your company
* Adopt the correct software abstractions which allow for decoupling of teams and technology
* Embrace security-first principles to build in compliance, custody, and determinism into your systems

The KAF looks at adopting containers, Kubernetes, and the larger ecosystem as a three-pronged approach. First, using *containers, pods, and controllers* to build the correct abstractions between application, infrastructure, and operations teams. Secondly, recognizing that trainng, new ways of thinking, and that new organizational incentives are required to fully adopt a modern container workload. Lastly, the KAF details the secure-by-design potential that Kubernetescan offer when the appropriate native controls, coupled with ecosystem tools, added to empowered teams, can offer you.
